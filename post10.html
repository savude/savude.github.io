                        Bootstrap is a powerful toolkit - a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript tools for creating and building web pages and web applications. It is a free and open source project, hosted on GitHub, and originally created by (and for) Twitter. Since its official release in 2011, it has undergone several changes, and it’s now one of the most stable and responsive frameworks available. It’s loved by web developers of all levels, as it gives them the capability to build a functional, attractive website design. 
                   </p>

                   <p>
                        Its main advantages are, as I mentioned previously, that it is responsive by design, it maintains wide browser compatibility, it offers consistent design by using re-usable components, and it is very easy to use and quick to learn. It offers rich extensibility using JavaScript, coming with built-in support for jQuery plugins and a programmatic JavaScript API.  
                   </p>

                    <p>
                            With Bootstrap, web developers can concentrate on the development work, without worrying about design, and get a good looking website up and running quickly. A novice developer, like myself, with some knowledge of HTML and CSS can say in the span of three months, easily (I truly exaggerate this bit because nothing about this assignment was easy for me) use BootStrap and succeed.   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            BootStrap provides a solid foundation for any website, irrespective of project size. It provides an easy to use framework that comes with a set of sensible defaults and themes that can be added on for a sense of a customized look, which is what I did with my website. Bootstrap also provides great typography, but I used Google’s fonts for this (they were free and also very simple to install). I used Bootstrap in my project because it it’s framework was easy to use & mainly because it saved me a considerable amount of effort.
