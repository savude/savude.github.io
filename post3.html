                        Once upon a time, my mother had a personal policy to not join any social networks. At first, she didn't understand the value of posting updates about her personal life on some commercial web sites, where anyone/everyone can see & track her presence. And besides, she would say, “I have Yahoo,” as if that's the universal currency for top notch tech. 
                   </p>

                   <blockquote class="blockquote">Her actual motto was "If it ain’t broke, why bother fixing it?</blockquote>

                   <p>
                        This narrative changed immediately after she started her business and had her clients asking her for her LinkedIn profile, Skype call dates, Google Hangout video conferences, Twitter Handle etc. Social media ceased being a tool that she could put into use whenever she’d like, but more of a necessity that she needed to promote her brand amongst her clientele, and more importantly, a tool she used to communicate with her partners, suppliers, employees etc. All she speaks of now is digital this, digital that and even recently enrolled on a digital marketing course to understand this “tech world” better. It’s been interesting to see her evolution over time and the impact of technology on people’s lives. People have adapted to these changing times by adapting devices, software, ‘trends’ that all encompass the digital world in order to remain relevant and not obsolete with time. I think it’s a great lesson for any young person who for now might be in with the times, change is inevitable over time. And being adept with what is current today, might not be the case tomorrow and therefore we have to train ourselves to be adaptable and willing to embrace the unknown. 
                   </p>

                    <p>
                        In conclusion, yes, the veterans can be changed!
