                        I think I’m actually a professional procrastinator. I know in my previous articles I’ve claimed, I’ve been working on this website for three months, issaaalieee naaw! I really started this project I think it was mid-July when Tabot sent us a reminder that our projects were due sometime in August and I had like a mini nervous breakdown. But see the thing is, this isn’t the first time I’ve procrastinated to get on with my projects and if you’re like me (please just, stop) but if you are, here are a few tips that could hopefully help you and me because this really is a post for ME, to get on with it. Ok, so here are the “golden” tips:
                   </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Antidote 1: Self-Care </h2>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">The first thing to ask yourself, if you’re procrastinating, is: “Am I tired? Do I need to take care of myself?”</blockquote>

                   <p>
                        Often my procrastinating is simply because I haven’t been getting good rest, or I’ve been doing so much that I’m tiring myself out. Maybe I need a massive cup of coffee to take care of the massive hangover I just came into work with. (Just me? Ok, then). Or maybe I’ve been working hard on a project for a week without a mental break.  
                   </p>

                   <p>
                        When this is the case, the answer is to get some rest. Take a nap. Sleep in. Disconnect, and watch a YouTube video or crotchet (that’s really fancy talk for knitting). Or maybe just go for a walk? Do whatever works for you but the main idea is to get some sleep, disconnect, get away from everything, and perhaps meditate. Reflect, contemplate, find stillness and quietude
                   </p>

                   <p>
                        Once you’re refreshed (and it might just mean a 20-minute nap and a short meditation), you can find mindful focus again.
                   </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Make a (Small) Commitment</h2>

                    <p>
                            What helped me during one point of my procrastination was to make a commitment to a friend that I would do a bunch of work at a specific time. And if I didn’t do that work, I would have to suffer a consequence that we both agreed to.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            Needless to say, I stuck to my commitment. I got the work done, no matter what it took.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">Protip: Make the action you commit to doing be fairly small. That will make it easier to get started, and you’ll be able to launch into your commitment without too much trouble.</blockquote>
                    
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Antidote 3: Create the Space</h2>

                    <p>
                            A big part of the problem with constant procrastination is that we are in an environment that is conducive to distraction, to doing small tasks (checking my IG feed, Twitter, funny memes, cat videos (OMG cat videos are the worst, but also the best thing in the world) checking messages, answering calls, etc.).  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            You might set yourself to doing the work, but then decide to just check one thing real quick. And that leads to checking another. And before you know it, a whole day has gone by. It’s hard to focus when you’re in an environment like this.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            So the smallest first step you need to do is create the space. Turn off Wi-Fi, set up an Internet blocker, unplug your router, or get somewhere where there is no Internet. With an environment like this, you will be able to focus much better. Create the space, clear everything away, then get to it!
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Antidote 4: Find the Joy in It</h2>

                    <p>
                            When we think of the work as something huge and difficult, stressful and overwhelming, or just plain old boring… it’s hard not to procrastinate. So a switch in mindset would be hugely beneficial. If you love doing it, you won’t procrastinate!  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            The trick is to find the joy in the activity. Don’t just do it like it’s a chore to be gotten over with, or some ordeal you need to make it through. Instead, see it as a treasured activity that you get to do. What an amazing thing it is to be alive, doing this activity right now, in the miracle of existence and of this moment! What a breath-taking thing, if only we don’t take it for granted, and fully appreciate the fleeting joyful beauty of this moment.
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            So in each moment, appreciate the profound power of what you’re doing, be fully immersed in it, fully mindful of the sensations of the experience and see if there isn’t the thrill of joy to be found in every motion, every breath. Your brain will start to program itself to dive into this joyful activity, and you will be awake to the world.
                    </blockquote>
                    
                    <p>
                            The last part, actually really helped me, because it really is difficult to find meaning and joy in some tasks. But there truly is a silver lining in everything and every situation. Find it and use it to motivate you to get a move on. <br>

                            Hope this helps! 
                            
                    </p>
