                        BUMA is my mother’s company, passion and baby. My involvement with the company therefore started long before I commenced my internship. However the internship provided me with an official framework to be finally tied to the business. I chose this specific internship because after I’ve completed my studies, I’d like to work alongside my mom in the business and this was a perfect opportunity to experience first-hand how the business functions. I was also excited about working in a industry that I didn’t know much about, and receive direct apprenticeship from the various partners, employees and suppliers that BUMA has. For me, working in a completely new industry greatly appealed to me because it would mean that I was adaptable and the skills that I have acquired can be applied in any field. This is the most important skill for me to acquire and this internship was the perfect opportunity to test this. 
                   </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">But how exactly did I acquire my internship? </h2>

                   <p>
                        Two weeks before leaving school, I had no internship, neither did I have any prospects for an internship. I remember feeling apprehensive of what is to come next and I had a chat with my mom that night. She was working on getting a new partnership so that she could expand her range of products, and she could also tap into new markets as a result. As she was explaining, I had so many questions for her, who was this new supplier, what did they offer, what was their value proposition, why them & not their competitors? And she didn’t have the response to all these questions, and she told me as a joke, maybe you can help me find the solutions, and just like that I was hired. Not the most conventional type of interview, but this is how I got my internship two weeks before heading back home. 
                   </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My Position</h2>

                    <p>
                        I was hired as a Business Development Intern, which was aligned more with the company and its current set of strategies (it’s in its expansion phase), over what I believe I’m more qualified to do, which is in line with my degree. However, as I mentioned previously, I was keen to take on this position because I believe that knowledge/skills do not work in isolation and so I was assured I would apply my learnings somewhere.
