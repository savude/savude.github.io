                        As the end to my three and a half month internship at BUMA draws near, I’ve been feeling extremely sentimental, and thought it would be rewarding to discuss some of my learnings as a business development intern working in a start-up and offer new interns a couple of insights about entering a new field which they perhaps, have no prior knowledge and/or experience of.
                   </p>

                   <p>
                        My experience here surpassed my highest expectations regarding the professional business training provided, the high-impact mentoring I received, and newfound network of supportive colleagues and friends. I came in as a blank slate with almost no background in business and I’m about to leave with a wealth of experience and knowledge in the field that I know I can replicate in my future endeavours, and even in the course of my studies. 
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Specific Job Description</h2>

                    <p>
                            In my time at BUMA, I’ve been helping with a lot of the company’s marketing & branding strategies. Specifically I’ve partaken in their sponsored online marketing campaigns through Facebook and LinkedIn & have also assisted in organizing the company’s booth at the annual trade show for the Printing & Packaging Industry. Executing the digital marketing media strategies was eye opening as it introduced me to another realm of social media that I wasn’t aware of. Suddenly the posts that we created had targets, had to be monitored and compared to see what was most successful, amongst what audience & most importantly the conversion rate. I’d never viewed social media in that light. Within my work context, it was a tool that was used to: track the level of engagement between our users and ourselves, to receive feedback of our services and a measure to see if we were having the impact that we had set out to achieve. It was awesome. 
                    </p>

                    <blockquote class="blockquote"> Curating a Marketing Plan from Scratch </blockquote>

                    <p>
                            The gruelling part of the internship came in when the company set out to develop its new marketing strategy.  It was hard, because I’ve never developed such a plan before but more so because this was a defining moment for the company. This plan was a manifestation of all the beliefs, values and experience that BUMA offers its clientele. It’s a representation of why all the 6 full time employees come to work every day, an external manifestation of our identity. It was a daunting task, because I didn’t want to let anyone down by not creating the “perfect plan.” But this is where team work and effort counts the most. I had the help of literally everyone in the organization as we would sit and brainstorm and when things would get too hard or too ‘serious’ as my mama says, we’d go out for a meal or cocktails (on the company’s tab). The process then finally became fun and interesting, because as the mantra goes, “it’s never that serious.” And because, we were passionate, willing to share and positive about the whole process, the plan was created a week before our final deadline. So to new interns, my advise would definitely to embrace the fear, collaborate and ermmm, it really is never that serious. Having fun is such an essential part to producing good quality work. 
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Signing Off</h2>

                    <p>
                            Finally I closed off my internship with a trip to Tanzania where I travelled with my mother. I was given the amazing opportunity to pitch the company to a group of new clients, which was intimidating, but also exciting. From this trip, I learnt the value of preparation, preparation and some more preparation. My entire internship was perhaps a culmination of this trip and I was able to speak honestly and coherently of my experiences, my work and why I believe in the products that we sell. We sell technical products, which come in with their own industry jargon and for me, took time before I had completely mastered the names and all their different functions/applications. It took time, effort and patience to achieve that and in Tanzania when I was in front of a group of people, it felt like I had come a full circle through the duration of my internship and I was proud of myself and confident about the fact that no matter what the world throws at me, I’ll manage. So I urge you to try something new, something out of your comfort zone and go through all the motions that come with finding doing something new - be excited, convicted to push forward, frustrated that it’s not coming along as fast, irritated because it’s hard, and finally feel the magic and satisfaction when you finally figure it out or just simply, after completing a task. New things are hard, but hard is good. Hard is adaptable. Hard is rewarding.
