                        There’s a new tide that has now become well established in different countries, such as my own, Kenya, and it is on the question of STEM subjects. Societies are now asking themselves how do they involve more of their citizens in these subjects. Many governments have taken it upon their mandate to further this agenda in the form of including new educational policies and what feels really like marketing campaigns & CSR projects amongst big corporations to “include” more diverse (this is synonymous for women, children and low income individuals) in the field. 
                   </p>

                   <p>
                        Here at home companies like Microsoft for example arrange field days where their employees go to a random, public school usually in rural settings and they ‘offer’ their services in the form of a computer fully packed with Office Products etc. and they spend a day teaching children who’ve never been exposed to a computer before on STEM. The government is on the same wavelength with their mission to purchase laptops for kids who once again, have never been exposed to any of these technologies and leaving them at the mercies of equally clueless teachers. Also we haven’t highlighted the irony that surrounds the entire situation. These rural school don’t have access to electricity much less access to the internet. So what happens with these massive projects targeting the “youth” and marginalized? They are incredibly unsuccessful because in the mode of implementation. There seems to be a great disconnect between the discussion that is being had on the global stage and its implementation.

                            Now that is the scenario present on the ground but there are students who do indeed show resilience and are sufficiently motivate to pursue STEM in college. Many can say that it is due to passion and interest, the ‘good’ reasons to pursue a course right? But if we are to be truthful just for a hot minute, many students pursue courses in these fields because of career prospects which long and short is, money. Money is a massive motivator for pursuing these courses. With ‘big’ companies the likes of Microsoft, Google and IBM opening more and more branches in Africa, there is in fact an increase in demand for these skills. Getting paid gets the job done. Take a look at <a href="http://yosefk.com/blog/a-simple-way-to-get-more-people-to-code.html"> this article</a>  by Yossi Kreinin to get some more perspective on the matter. I’ll be honest, the first time I read the piece, I thought it was hilarious, in an ironic type of way. But after reading it a few more times (3 to be exact) I think it applies to any STEM promoting context.  If we truly believe that STEM is the next big boom, our approach to mainstreaming it must reflect this belief.
